// CONSTRUCTORS
// Here is where you'll create your constructors for you player and monster.
// e.g. function Monster(){};
// e.g. function Player(){};


// GLOBAL VARIABLES
// You'll also want to create variables for the specific players and monsters.
// e.g. var purplePeopleEater = new Monster();
// e.g. var tinaFey = new Player();
// e.g. var attackMode = function(target){ Some code that produces an attack - pew, pew! };



// ACTIONS
// This is where jQuery will come into play and where you'll set a lot of your
// interactions for players and monsters. (e.g. player selection, attack interactions)
// e.g. $('.purple-people-eater').click(function () { Some code that attacks the monster! };
